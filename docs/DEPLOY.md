# Deployment

## Current verified state

- provider reported by the user: **SiteGround**;
- configured protocol: **passive FTP on port 21**;
- FTP account home contains `sedicivalvole.app/public_html`;
- configured web root: `sedicivalvole.app/public_html`;
- canonical development URL: [https://sedicivalvole.app/](https://sedicivalvole.app/);
- the previous wrong FTP-home diagnostics tree was removed after exact-name validation and explicit authorization;
- the canonical root now hosts the current Drive Lab build.

## Canonical-root deployment evidence — 2026-08-26

- read-only remote identity gate: **PASS** for the SiteGround placeholder and every legacy build file;
- upload: **PASS**, 4 files, 1,916,503 bytes;
- exact cleanup: **PASS**, 5 files and 3 directories removed;
- root remote listing after publication: 2 entries (`index.html` and `assets/`);
- canonical URL: **HTTP 200**;
- obsolete `/diagnostics/drive-lab/`: **HTTP 404**;
- HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and image: local/live byte counts and SHA-256 hashes all identical;
- selected-browser smoke test: splash, `TEST & START`, GPS permission state, audio/visual controls, and integrated report all rendered in English;
- observed HTTP edge header: `server: nginx`; this identifies the responding edge but does not prove the provider's full origin topology.

## Modular Aperture publication evidence — 2026-08-26

- target commit: `487f9ee` plus the deployment-safety follow-up documented below;
- read-only FTP identity gate: **PASS**, 3 recognized canonical-root entries;
- non-destructive upload: **PASS**, 5 files, 247,235 bytes;
- cleanup: **SKIPPED** with `--preserve-existing`; previous assets retained for cache overlap;
- cache-busted HTML and new JavaScript/CSS: **HTTP 200** and byte-identical local/live SHA-256 hashes;
- new JavaScript: `index-B5aZa7cA.js`, 229,774 bytes, SHA-256 `04505443b6b2cb9d17034b30ec09ad082c74e8dd6a91b5e5e5cf4680e4c30e15`;
- new CSS: `index-DlWvHqKL.css`, 11,743 bytes, SHA-256 `492e30abcb5e19e06209b81f3b9ae3f45d47db731a2c89b2bc0a7c7961532ef3`;
- cache-busted HTML: 655 bytes, SHA-256 `a3b80cf30a6d4ccae696953ac5ee2c6e014fb984af4f7d1054b4c22d5268eec0`;
- canonical bare `/`: **FAIL / stale** after two checks, still 587 bytes and still referencing `index-CKjMDFcj.js` plus `index-BbWXMXk1.css`;
- cache-busted `/` and direct `/index.php`: current build; bare-root convergence or an authorized provider cache flush is still required before this publication can be called a successful canonical deployment.

- live selected-browser QA at `773 × 601`: **PASS** for WebGL2, Web Audio, v3 JSON, frame/RTT cards, scrollable report, and Demo response;
- one user-authorized live v3 report: **202 / accepted by the server mail transport**; Gmail inbox delivery remains pending user confirmation;
- built-in version reported by the live v3 report: `0.0.0`, matching `VERSION`;
- canonical bare `/`: **FAIL / provider cache still stale**, 587 bytes, SHA-256 `0407fb0914ab6d11655184a54e6ace05523b0ec4d081d8543fc3727de9b57150`, still referencing `index-CKjMDFcj.js` and `index-BbWXMXk1.css`;
- this upload is therefore not recorded as a successful canonical deployment until the provider cache is flushed and bare `/` converges.

- live selected-browser QA at `773 × 601`: **PASS** for the dark terminal void, full off-canvas header/footer, persistent speed-only state, control wake, diagnostics access, and zero relevant console warnings/errors;
- canonical bare `/`: **FAIL / provider cache still stale**, still returning the prior 587-byte `x-proxy-cache: HIT` body and old assets;
- publication is available through the cache-busted root and direct PHP entry, but canonical deployment completion remains pending the SiteGround cache flush.

- publication is verified through `/?qa=bead2d7-forward-motion` and direct `/index.php`, but canonical deployment completion remains pending the SiteGround cache flush.

`.env` is local, user-filled, and ignored. Scripts must parse it as data, keep credentials in memory, and print only sanitized stage results. Never source or evaluate `.env`.

## Security limit

Plain FTP sends credentials and content without encryption. Prefer certificate-validated FTPS or host-key-verified SFTP if SiteGround makes either available. Do not silently change protocol.

## Gate for every development deployment

1. Confirm the intended build, protocol, host account, and exact remote path.
2. Build and pass functional/visual QA locally.
3. Upload assets before `index.html` so the entry point never references missing files.
4. Never print credentials or raw FTP errors.
5. Verify the canonical URL after upload:
   - HTTP status;
   - HTML and asset paths;
   - local/live sizes and SHA-256 hashes;
   - current version marker;
   - cache headers after a controlled reload;
   - visible behavior in the selected browser.

Use `--preserve-existing` when publication is authorized but deletion of legacy remote files is not. This mode uploads content-addressed assets and the dynamic root entry, preserves any static entry and legacy tree, and reports cleanup as skipped. Canonical verification is still mandatory because a preserved `index.html` or edge cache may continue to win over the new `index.php`.

Use `--verify-only` to run the configuration, connection, exact-directory, and remote-identity gates without uploading, overwriting, or deleting any remote file.

An upload alone is not a successful deployment. The user reports that hosting caches are disabled or cleared, but that statement is context rather than evidence. Do not infer Apache, Nginx, or other server topology from it.

Content-addressed JavaScript and CSS from the immediately previous entry point are retained during cache overlap. SiteGround has served stale canonical HTML briefly even while exposing the new origin timestamp; deleting the previous bundle in the same deployment can therefore break cached clients. Cache-busted verification confirms the new entry point, while the previous bundle remains available until canonical HTML converges.

The canonical SiteGround deployment uses a generated `index.php` entry with explicit no-store/no-cache response headers. The Vite `index.html` remains the reproducible build input and stays available to the separate Sites-compatible package, but it is removed from the FTP root only after the dynamic entry is uploaded and verified byte-for-byte over FTP. Use `--stage-php-entry` to upload and verify the dynamic entry without switching the root during a first provider check.

The first dynamic-entry activation passed FTP identity and byte verification. Direct `/index.php` returns the current 658-byte HTML with `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0` and a byte-identical local/live SHA-256. However, the bare `/` cache key still returns a previously cached 587-byte static entry with `x-proxy-cache: HIT`. This response is upstream of the replaced origin file and cannot be safely purged with FTP credentials.

Required provider action: use Site Tools → Speed → Caching → Dynamic Cache → **Flush Cache** for `sedicivalvole.app`, following [SiteGround's cache-flush procedure](https://www.siteground.com/kb/clear-site-cache/). If SiteGround CDN is enabled, also use its **Cache Purge** or temporary **Development Mode**, as documented in [SiteGround's CDN controls](https://www.siteground.com/kb/manage-cdn). After the purge, verify that bare `/` returns the current 658-byte entry, references the current content-addressed assets, and no longer reports the stale `HIT` body.

For the energy-wave deployment, the canonical unqualified URL continued returning the previous 587-byte HTML body, while a cache-busted query returned the new 658-byte HTML with a byte-identical local/live SHA-256. Both previous and current JavaScript bundles return HTTP 200, so cached clients remain functional. An unauthenticated HTTP `PURGE` request was rejected with 403; do not retry or bypass provider cache controls without an authorized SiteGround mechanism.

## Development policy

During this private development phase, the current verified product build is deployed directly to the canonical root after user approval. Diagnostics remain accessible from the product's integrated report. Do not publish credentials, `_references/`, source archives, or local-only files.
